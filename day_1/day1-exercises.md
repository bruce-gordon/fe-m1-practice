# HTML and CSS

### Structure and Text

1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?

HTML code contains the text that should appear on a website, as well as information about the formatting.  

2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?

An element is a section of HTML code, like a heading or paragraph, or the body of the code.
A tag goes inside the two angled brackets (<p>, for example).  Tags are used at the beginning and end of an element.  They show the boundaries of that element and help define it.    

3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

Attributes provide more information about an element.  They have an "attribute name" and "attribute value".
Attributes are generally predefined or follow a set format.

4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

The BODY is everything that shows up on the web browser.  The body is what we see when we go to a web page.
The HEAD contains information *about* the page, but not info that will be visible on the actual page.  
The TITLE shows up on the tab for a page or on the top of the browser when you are looking at a page.  The code for the title is contained within the head.

5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

Click on *view*, then click *developer*, and then *view source*

6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.

`<h1></h1>` is a heading tab and creates different sized headings or subheadings.  Changing the 1 to a different number will create a smaller subheading.
`<body></body>` is a body tag.  This contains everything that the user will see on a web page.
`<title></title>` is a title tag.  This contains the title of the page, which will be visible on the top of the browser or tab for the page.
`<head></head>` is a head tag.  This is where information about the page that doesn't actually appear can be stored.  For example, this is where the title would go.
`<html></html>` is the HTML tag.  This shows that everything written inside of it is HTML code.

7.  What are empty elements?

Empty elements cannot have other elements nested inside them and do not have a closing tag.

8.  What is semantic markup?

Semantic markup provides additional information beyond the basic structure of headings and paragraphs.  This includes tags like <em> for emphasis or <blockquote> to indicate that a block of text is a quote.

9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
